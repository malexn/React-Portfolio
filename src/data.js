        "For the course DM2601 Media Technology and Interaction Design we were to find an issue around interaction with contemporary and future media. What we found out in our literature review were that podcasts needs to continue to evolve, especially they need to go beyond sound. They need to construct relationships with the audience and keep them engaged and interactive. The project were to design a possible solution by applying methods such as idea generation, selection and evaluation together with various types of sketching and prototyping methods. The solution that we came up with was the idea of an more interactive relationship between the producer and the audience. We came up with two sections, the “Episode feed” and “Comments”. The episode feed is managed by the producer who can, beforehand, timestamp additional information and resources on an episode. These timestamps will then be marked on the timeline. The audience will be notified with notifications when additional information is available while listening to the episode. The comment section is inspired by Reddit, YouTube and Instagram. The idea behind the function is to let the audience integrate more with the podcast and the episodes which could encourage more interaction between the producer and the audience.

More often than not, language cafés groups are far too big and the attendants have varying skill levels which tends to disrupt the flow of conversation. For more information, click on the image.",
